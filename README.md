# Imgur-Image-Finder
A simple script which searches for and displays imgur images.

## Requirements:
    Ruby
    faraday
    launchy
    colorize
    json

## Known Issues:
If you search something obscure or unsearchable (such as NSFW things, as per Imgur's rules) and the program doesn't find any gallaries, the program will break.

Due to the use of Linux specific functions, this program might not work on windows machines.
